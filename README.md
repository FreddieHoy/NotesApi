### Here we go

Litte diary of events

#### Jan 1st ish - wrote some code with end points, users and notes

- Pretty fun just hammering away for a bit

#### March 7th - how the hell did I make a data base?

Nice one, I wrote a script to do data base things with some commands.

okay brew is your new best friend `brew services list` is your home.

Then `brew services start` something...

- ahhh ok after restarting and re-install everything I realised I was using the wrong command. I was running
  `psql postgresql` but it's `psql postgres`

- check what users are installed - \du (inside postgres)

...

Basically all the good set up notes were here - https://blog.logrocket.com/nodejs-expressjs-postgresql-crud-rest-api-example/
